We will be using the book Strategic Management by Frank Rothaermel, from McGraw-Hill 
Education.  
The fifth edition of the book can be acquired using the link below at the following prices:  
eBook rental (180 days): $59 
eBook lifetime purchase: $94

rothaermel/M9781260261288.html#buying-options 
If you acquire the eBook instead of the paperback edition, you can have immediate access to the 
book. We will be using the 5th edition, but if you have access to the 3rd or 4th editions, the 
content is close enough, although there are some chapters that have changed. If you use an older 
edition, it is your responsibility to obtain the study materials for the missing or outdated sections 
(let me know if you need help).  
Course Description 
Strategy is an exciting field of study and practice. Strategy (also referred to as strategic 
management) is defined as an integrated set of commitments, decisions, and actions that an 
individual/organization intends to take in their quest to gain and sustain competitive advantage. 
To gain such an advantage, actors must create, deliver, and capture value from their 
customers/end users.  
This course, Business Strategy (MGT 4800) analyzes three stages of the strategic management 
process: 1) Analysis, 2) Formulation, and 3) Implementation. The basic goal of the course is to 
teach you how to 1) conduct an analysis of both an industry and a firm, 2) formulate a strategy 
(both at the corporate and at the business level) and 3) design an organization capable of 
implementing it.  
The course is primarily concerned with the strategic management process as it affects firms and 
executives, although insights gained from this course are also applicable to students, professors, 
politicians, athletes, governments, nonprofits, and military organizations.  
To enhance our learning process, cases, exercises and videos are used to provide practical 
meaning for many of the concepts that are explored throughout this course. Students are 
expected to apply learning from class, critical reasoning, and creativity in the analysis of the cases. 
Course Learning Outcomes 
By the end of this course, you should be able to: 
1. Understand and explain what strategy is and how managers can use it to gain and sustain a 
competitive advantage for their organization. 

2. Integrate and apply your prior business training and experience to identify and address key 
business problems and opportunities. 
3. Conduct a strategic analysis of an organization and its competitive environment using a variety 
of different conceptual approaches. 
4. Generate and assess alternatives for resolving a strategic issue and recommend an actionable 
plan to address that issue. 
5. Understand and explain the dynamic nature of crafting and implementing strategy in a 
competitive environment. 
6. Communicate your ideas more effectively in both written and oral formats. 
Preparation 
For an effective learning process, it is vital that you spend time carefully preparing before class. 
You are expected to have read the book chapters and articles beforehand, watched the videos, and 
completed your homework. 
This will allow you to actively participate in the discussions that will form a vital part of the 
learning process. At various times you will be expected to start a discussion or answer a specific 
question, so unless you have thought about and adopted a personal position on relevant issues, it 
is difficult to contribute to, and learn from, the other members of the group. If the thought of 
starting such a discussion makes you feel particularly uncomfortable, please talk to me. A sound 
preparation for the class will also consist of reading the assigned chapters before we discuss them 
in class. 
I expect that you will 
• Come to class prepared to discuss the materials assigned for the week. 
• Complete your weekly assignments. 
• Participate actively in class discussions.  
• Take responsibility for your own learning. 
• Check established communication mechanisms (e.g., e-mail, blackboard) daily. 
• Attend all classes and complete the assigned tasks and readings within the specified time 
frames. 
• Notify the course leader if circumstances prevent the completion of any assigned readings 
or tasks, or attendance to a class. 
• Communicate any difficulties that might impair learning or academic performance. 
• Follow the guidelines provided for the submission of written work. 
• Provide constructive feedback to the instructor regarding the content and delivery of the 
course. 

You can expect that I will 
▪ Provide a course outline that clearly states the objectives of the course. 
▪ Provide a weekly breakdown of the course content, reading requirements and any tasks. 
▪ Provide a program of study that is challenging, intellectually stimulating, and allows for 
opportunities to analyze practical and theoretical aspects of strategic management. 
▪ Provide a clear indication of the forms of assessment and dates for exams and submission 
of written work. 
▪ Create a climate that enhances student learning and achievement and is conducive to the 
open sharing of ideas. 
▪ Provide constructive feedback on work within a reasonable time frame.  
Guidelines for preparation for class 
Before: 
1. Read the book chapter assigned for that week. 
2. Read any articles assigned. 
3. Watch the videos assigned. 
4. Complete the online assignments.  
 
After: 
1. After the class, make sure you make note of what you missed and how you can enhance or 
continue to enhance the level of preparedness for the next class session. As well, take notes 
during the class to help you learn and to integrate your learning. 
2. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask me. 
Basic class etiquette 
• NO answering a cell phone or texting during class meetings.  
• NO late arrivals and early departures. Late arrivals or early departures are disruptive and 
will affect your participation grade. 
• No disruptive behavior, like interacting with someone else on camera during online 
sessions. 
• Blackboard: I will use BlackBoard extensively to post reading material, presentation slides 
and for other communication. Please make sure that you have access to BlackBoard and 
please check it regularly for course related updates. 

Student Accessibility & Disabilities 
Any student who may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the 
class instructor privately to discuss the student’s specific needs and provide written 
documentation from the Office of Student Accessibility Services. Students not yet registered as a 
student with a disability should contact the Office of Student Accessibility Services. 
For questions about accommodation or Student Accessibility Services please contact 740-593-
2620 or disabilities@ohio.edu.   
Emotional and psychological assistance 
We recognize that university life can bring its own stresses and strains, especially considering the 
circumstances we are all experiencing during this pandemic. If you feel that you are having 
difficulties coming to terms with any aspect of your personal, work, or university career, the 
Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) is available to OU students who have chosen 
Wellbeing for the current semester, free of charge. Feel free to talk to me at any time, and/or 
contact the CPS staff at 740-593-1616 or visit CPS website at http://www.ohio.edu/counseling. A 
24/7 Crisis Intervention Service is also available at 740-593-1616.  
Fostering an inclusive environment 
Ohio University and The Department of Management believes it is important to respond to 
insensitive and inappropriate behavior in a spirit of collegiality, mutual respect, and 
professionalism. If you believe that you have been the target of discrimination by another student, 
a faculty member, or staff member, due to age, disability, ethnicity, gender, race, political beliefs, 
religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or cultural group membership, you can choose to pursue one 
or more of the following avenues: 
1. The most direct approach, if you feel comfortable doing so, is to speak directly to the person 
whose behavior you consider to be inappropriate. 
2. You may also speak to the instructor, another faculty member, or the University’s Office for 
Institutional Equity. 
It is important that you speak immediately to someone with whom you feel comfortable in order 
that your concerns can be handled promptly and fairly.  
Plagiarism and academic misconduct 
Next, a note on plagiarism and academic misconduct. To plagiarize means to attempt to pass off 
the ideas or words of somebody else as your own. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, the 

use, paraphrase, or direct quotation, of the published or unpublished work of another person 
without full or clear acknowledgement. It also includes the unacknowledged use of materials 
prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic 
materials. This is an academic offence that the University takes very seriously. Any attempt to 
copy from another student during exams will be viewed in a similarly serious manner. See Section 
VIII.F of the student Code of Conduct for more information on academic misconduct. 
The submission of work used in other classes will equally not be accepted. Any student found 
guilty of cheating or plagiarism may receive a grade of F for the class as well as referral to the 
Office of Community Standards. Students may appeal academic sanctions through the grade 
appeal process; the Office of Community Standards and Student Responsibility, however, 
may impose additional sanctions.  
Use of Artificial Intelligence 
The use of Generative AI, such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing-Chat, must maintain the highest 
standards of academic integrity and adhere to the OU Code of Student Conduct.  
The use of Generative AI should be seen as a tool to enhance academic research, not as a 
replacement for critical thinking and originality in assignments. Students are not permitted to 
submit assignments that have been fully or partially generated by AI unless explicitly stated in the 
assignment instructions. All work submitted must be the original work of the student. Any ideas 
garnered from Generative AI research must be acknowledged with proper in-text citation and 
reference. Students may be asked to save the AI chat as a PDF file for verification. 
Rights to revise 
The instructor reserves the right to revise this syllabus. If there is a change, then it will be 
announced to the class either during a regularly scheduled class meeting or by email.

Online Assignments (320 points -40 points each) 
There will be 9 individual online assignments. Those assignments will be either multiple choice or 
open-ended questions related to the module and the case assigned for that week. See calendar for 
deadlines.  
You only need to complete 8 assignments out of 9. If you complete all 9 assignments, I will only 
consider the best 8. However, completing all 9 assignments can potentially increase your grade, 
because your assignment with the lowest grade will be dropped. 
You will find the links and instructions to complete these assignments on Blackboard.  

Attendance (40 points) 
There are 28 classes in the course. You will get 2 points for each class you attend. That means that 
need to attend 20 classes to obtain all 40 points for attendance. In other words, you can miss up 
to 8 classes with no penalty, for any reason. This includes personal reasons, job interviews, 
religious holidays, medical emergencies, and covid (including both testing positive or simply 
being exposed). I believe this gives you more than enough flexibility to deal with any situation, 
expected or unexpected. I do not need to know the reasons for your absences.  
Religious/spiritual holidays, celebrations or organized activities: the university establishes 
that students/you may be absent for up to three (3) days each academic semester, without 
penalty, to take time off for reasons of faith or religious or spiritual belief system or to participate 
in organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or other 
religious or spiritual organization. According to the policy, students are required to notify the 
instructor in writing of specific dates requested for alternative accommodations no later than 
fourteen (14) days after the first day of instruction. These requests will remain confidential (for 
more information about this policy, students may contact the Director and Title IX Coordinator, 
Equity and Civil Rights Compliance, Lindley Hall, 006, 740-593-9140, Equity@ohio.edu. Since the 
course attendance policy already allows for up to 8 absences with no penalty, the 3 
absences for religious/spiritual reasons are included in those 8 absences. Please plan 
accordingly.   
Bonus for attendance: If you attend 25 classes, you will get a 10-point bonus on top of the 40 
points for attendance. If you attend all 28 classes, the bonus will be 20 points. This may help you 
get a better grade at the end of the course. These 10-20 points are extra credit, on top of the 1,000 
points for the course. 
Final comment on attendance: Even though you can technically miss 8 classes with no penalty 
for attendance, this may affect your participation grade (see next section), because you obviously 
cannot participate if you are not in class. Also, keep in mind that attendance is critical for your 
success in this course, because if you miss classes, you will miss a significant amount of learning 
and will have to do a much bigger effort on your own to catch up. In other words, missing a few 
classes may not affect your attendance grade, but it may affect your grade in other ways. In sum, 
unless you have a serious reason not to come to class, I strongly recommend you attend.  
Participation (60 points) 
You are expected to be able to discuss the topic for that week and the assigned homework, which 
is usually related to a case. You need to be able to explain your answers, elaborate other potential 
arguments or explanations, and articulate them with the concepts studied in class. In sum, quality 
of participation is more important than quantity.  
The ability to contribute to a group discussion is an important managerial skill, and this course 
provides you with a low-risk opportunity to develop and practice this skill. Also, a significant part  

of the learning comes from the shared experience that is created when you engage in a lively 
conversation with your peers and your instructor. The willingness to engage in class discussions 
(and the necessary preparation to do so) is important for your own learning and that of your 
classmates.  
As a rule of thumb, students who make meaningful contributions at least once a week will get full 
points for participation at the end of the course. Smaller comments or short answers may earn 
you less credit but will still be counted. I strongly recommend that you participate regularly 
instead of waiting until the last few weeks. A glut of participation in the last one-two weeks will 
not make up for the lack of work during the rest of the semester. After the first couple of weeks, I 
will keep you updated about your participation on Blackboard, where you will be able to verify if 
your participation is above average, average, or below average.  
Exams (300 points) 
There will be a midterm and a final exam (150 points each). Both will be online, timed and will 
consist of multiple-choice questions. At the end of each module, I will provide a list of key 
concepts/terms/potential questions that you need to know for the exam. 
Strategy Analysis (280 points total) 
You will work in teams conducting a strategic analysis of a company facing a strategic challenge. 
The detailed instructions will be provided separately and discussed in class 3 (Wednesday, 
September 6
th
).
